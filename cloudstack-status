                     Cloudstack integration in pragma_boot

==============================================================
Mar 22-29, 2016 AIST
==============================================================

Goal: write a new driver for pragma_boot to use a CloudStack
      as an underlying virtual cluster provisioning platform.

Plan: Use CloudStack REST API to access to deploy and undeploy virtual 
      machines and clusters at AIST. 

Mapping of pragma_boot functions to CloudStack API:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pragma_boot        cloudstack API                      Description                    Status
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
allocate         deployVirtualMachine (startvm=false)  allocates VC                   done
deploy           startVirtualMachine                   deploy VC                      done
shutdown VMname  stopVIrtualMachine                    shuts down VC                  done, updated June 19
clean VMname     destroyVirtualMachine                 deallocate VC, rm disk images  done
list cluster     listVirtualMachine                    list virtual clusters status   done, updated June 19
list repository  listRepository                        list avail virtual images      done, July 8
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic funciotonality of pragma_boot  using CloudStack API is completed. 

The remaining issues are:

A. UCSD todo list 
1. Test deploying rocks-based virtual cluster (will test the networking)
2. Error checking for boundary conditions
3. Commenting code and making documentation
4. Special mode of clonezilla
  Upload virtual cluster -> create iso images -> move to google drive
  But would need a clonezilla instance on AIST resources to convert between
  clonezilla iso to qcawt. A better option will be to download a specific
  image (template) form the drive. Assumes that we can put pointer to GD url to pull template
5. Is it ok to snapshot the Biolinux VM now?
   How much of VM depends on IP of VM?
6. VM with data service on it that is bootable by pragmaboot
7. Finish, integrate method to get new images


UCSD DONE
1. Finalize functions "in progress" using REST API DONE
2. Finalize implementation of deploy, shutdown and clean functions of pragma_boot. DONE
3. vc-out.xml file propagation using userdata field and corresponding changes 
   to dynip roll and vm-out parser (debug authentication error.)
4. Test upload of templates from local repository and google drive. 
5. Test dual NIC configuration on the frontend
6. Test email from git
7. Nadya dual network interfaces 
8. Shava trying to pass network info through user data interface
9. Modifying Tarm's code 
10. Refactor code for better usability of new drivers and repositorires
11. Update networking interfaces, how to ask for public networking, upload new templates/VM
  New templates in cloudstack GUI, Community, MyISOs, Shared
12. Clean up of VC
13. Integrate/test cloud scheduler, demo prep


B. AIST todo list
1. Review CloudStack driver once UCSD complestes the code
2. Enable DNS entriesfor VM frontend
3. Enable templates reporitories
4. Jason - ask Gabriel about receipe for installing data service
   
AIST DONE
1. Access to CloudStack from one of pragma hosts. 
2. Enable public IP access to the VM's launched via CloudStack 
3. Jason to ASK: CS 4.8 api call - stopvirtualmachine, only returns jobID,
  complete list of info is not there. Why? Access control of user compared to
  admin? Is some functionality missing in GUI based on ACL.

Assumptions

1.  vcdb.txt file has the same format as for all other drivers.
    It lists cluster images (templates names have to be the same).
